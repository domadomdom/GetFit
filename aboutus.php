<p>GetFit is a web application project in which will be extremely beneficial to both coaches and clients since it aims to act as a link between both parties. In the beginning of every personâ€™s diet, training or getting into shape in general, there are certain times where the trainee gets puzzled and confused of what to do, act or even when regarding their diet, or lifting.
To resolve this issue, GetFit was suggested as a model that provides quick access to clients and great influence for trainers and coaches.
